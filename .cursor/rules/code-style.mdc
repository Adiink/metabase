if: generating UI or JSX code
then:
  - Prefer importing components from `/src/metabase/ui/components/`
  - Avoid using raw HTML elements if an equivalent exists in internal UI components
  - Reuse existing components instead of creating new ones unless explicitly requested
if: suggesting component libraries
then:
  - Do not suggest installing or using new UI libraries
  - If unsure, ask before using third-party UI components
if: asked to create a new UI component
then:
  - Search for similar components in `src/ui/components/`
  - Ask if an existing one should be modified first
if: conflicting priorities between speed and best practice
then:
  - Prioritize fast prototyping
  - Use available internal components and utilities
