# things to do:

## connect `turn-card-into-transform` with the endpoint
## connect frontend to endpoint (adapt turn into model button)


## assess what happens when you try to visualise the transform query

## transform table

## api endpoint to read from transform table

# open questions
## how do we want to return transform + model info
## design: how do we render the transform? do we want to "transparently" hide the backing view? c.f. "sql for this transform" + query editor
