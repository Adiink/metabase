```ts
type ActionMenuClickBehavior = {
  type: "actionMenu";
};
```

Makes click handler use default drills.
This is virtual, i.e. if a card has no clickBehavior,
it'd behave as if it's an "actionMenu".

## Type declaration

| Name | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| <a id="type"></a> `type` | `"actionMenu"` |
