# Issue #6767 - "Axis labels should be of the same type and resolution as data"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium-Low (4/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: The issue is related to the axis label formatting in charts, specifically how integer values are displayed in axes. The main components involved are:
   - `/frontend/src/metabase/visualizations/echarts/cartesian/option/axis.ts` - Handles axis configuration
   - Number parsing and formatting utilities in the codebase

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - The bug involves axis labels showing decimal places when the actual data contains only integers
   - From the screenshot, we can see axis values like "1.0" when they should be "1"
   - This is a formatting issue rather than a calculation error

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The issue requires understanding how number formatting is applied to axis labels
   - The fix will likely involve checking if values are integers and applying appropriate formatting
   - The change should be localized to axis label formatting functions

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to how axis labels are formatted, particularly in:
   - `buildMetricAxis` function in `axis.ts` which sets the formatter for Y-axis labels
   - `buildNumericDimensionAxis` function for X-axis labels

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating charts with integer-only values
   - Verifying that axis labels show integer values without decimal places
   - Checking that other numeric formatting still works correctly

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Modifying the formatter function to detect integer values
   - Applying appropriate number formatting that preserves the type (integer vs. decimal)
   - Ensuring the fix works across different chart types

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium-low difficulty bug because:
- The issue is well-defined and easily reproducible
- The change is limited to formatting logic, not core rendering
- The fix will likely be small and focused
- The relevant code is centralized in the axis formatting functions
- Testing is straightforward

A developer could likely fix this bug in 1-2 hours, including testing. The risk of regression is low as long as proper testing is done to ensure other number formatting scenarios still work correctly. This would be a good issue for a developer who is moderately familiar with the visualization system but doesn't require deep ECharts expertise.
