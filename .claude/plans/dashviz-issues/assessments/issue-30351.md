# Issue #30351 - "Give option to keep all white spaces and not get removed by default"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium (5/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: This issue involves how strings with multiple whitespace characters are displayed in tables:
   - The `TableInteractive` component that renders table visualizations
   - The `DataGrid` component that handles cell rendering
   - The formatting system that processes and normalizes values
   - HTML/CSS behavior that may be collapsing whitespace by default

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - Multiple consecutive whitespace characters are collapsed to a single space in table cells
   - This affects use cases like displaying formatted SQL EXPLAIN output where whitespace is meaningful
   - The issue isn't in the data itself but in how it's rendered in the UI
   - String display in scalar visualizations preserves whitespace correctly

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The issue could be in the React/HTML rendering which collapses whitespace by default
   - It may require CSS changes to preserve whitespace (`white-space: pre` or similar)
   - It could involve adding a new table visualization setting or column setting

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to:
   - The `BodyCell` component in the data grid where cell values are rendered
   - The `S.noWrap` CSS class that likely sets whitespace handling properties
   - Possibly default browser text rendering behavior that collapses whitespace

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating a table with cells containing multiple consecutive spaces
   - Verifying that whitespace is preserved with the new setting
   - Testing with various content types and table layouts

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Adding a new column setting to control whitespace handling
   - Modifying the cell rendering CSS to conditionally use `white-space: pre` or similar
   - Making sure this doesn't affect other visualizations or break table layouts

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium difficulty bug because:
- It involves understanding the interplay between formatting, rendering, and CSS
- It requires adding a new setting to the visualization options
- The fix itself might be relatively simple (CSS changes) but the implementation details require care
- It affects various use cases like SQL EXPLAIN output or any data where whitespace is meaningful
- It needs to balance preserving whitespace with maintaining usable table layouts

A developer familiar with the table visualization components and formatting system could likely fix this in 2-4 hours, including testing various scenarios and ensuring the new setting works properly. The solution needs to be carefully implemented to not break existing table behaviors and layouts.
