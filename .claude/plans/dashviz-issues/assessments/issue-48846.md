# Issue #48846 - "Bar chart data labels jump 1px on hover"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Low (3/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: The issue is related to bar chart data labels in ECharts visualization:
   - Bar chart rendering in CartesianChart component
   - Data label positioning logic in `getBarLabelLayout` in `series.ts`
   - ECharts hover state handling

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - Data labels on bar charts shift slightly (1px) when hovering over bars
   - This is likely due to how ECharts handles hover states and label positioning
   - The issue is purely visual with no functional impact

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The fix likely involves adjusting how the label position is calculated during hover states
   - The issue is probably in the ECharts configuration or event handling
   - It may involve understanding how the ECharts emphasis state affects label positioning

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to:
   - Label layout functions in `src/metabase/visualizations/echarts/cartesian/option/series.ts`
   - Hover state handling in `src/metabase/visualizations/visualizations/CartesianChart/use-chart-events.ts`

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating a bar chart with data labels enabled
   - Verifying that labels remain stable during hover interactions
   - Testing across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires one of these approaches:
   - Adjusting label layout settings to prevent movement during hover
   - Adding specific configuration to maintain stable positioning during state changes
   - Potentially overriding ECharts default behavior for label emphasis

### Overall Assessment:
This is a low difficulty bug because:
- It's a small visual glitch with minimal impact on functionality
- The issue is isolated to a specific interaction (hover) on a specific chart type
- It likely requires a small adjustment to existing configuration
- The solution probably doesn't require architectural changes
- It's labeled as a "good first issue" by the team

A developer with basic familiarity with the visualization system could likely fix this bug in 1-2 hours. The main challenge would be understanding how ECharts handles hover states and label positioning, but the fix itself would likely be quite small. This would be an excellent issue for someone new to the codebase or visualization system.
