# Issue #56272 - "Row value not shown for the largest bar in horizontal bar chart"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium (5/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: The issue involves the row chart (horizontal bar chart) and its data label display:
   - `RowChart` component in `RowChart.tsx` 
   - `RowChartView` component for rendering the chart
   - Data label handling in `data-labels.ts`

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - The value label for the largest bar in a horizontal bar chart is not displayed
   - This appears to be a specific edge case with the largest value
   - From a comment, there's a plan to reimplement this in ECharts in the future

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The issue likely involves the data label positioning logic
   - It could be related to domain boundary handling in `getDataLabel` function
   - The bug may involve the interaction between scales, bar size, and label placement

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to:
   - `getDataLabel` function in `data-labels.ts` which determines if a label should be shown
   - The check for `isOutOfDomain` might be incorrectly filtering out the largest value
   - Text placement logic in the `RowChartView` component

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating a horizontal bar chart with values of various sizes
   - Verifying that all values, including the largest one, show their labels
   - Testing with different data ranges and visualization settings

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Adjusting the domain boundary check in `getDataLabel` function
   - Potentially modifying how the scale domains are calculated to accommodate labels
   - Ensuring that fixes are compatible with the planned migration to ECharts

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium difficulty bug because:
- It involves understanding the interaction between scales, domains, and label positioning
- The code uses a combination of custom components and visualization libraries (visx)
- The bug is isolated to a specific edge case (largest value)
- The team comment suggests a future migration, which may affect how thoroughly the fix should be implemented

A developer would need moderate familiarity with D3 scales, SVG rendering, and the visualization system to properly fix this issue. The main challenge would be ensuring the fix doesn't break other scenarios while addressing this specific edge case.

The team has noted this issue might be addressed during a migration to ECharts, which suggests fixing it in the current implementation may not be the highest priority. An alternative approach might be to document the issue well for the planned reimplementation rather than fixing the current code.
