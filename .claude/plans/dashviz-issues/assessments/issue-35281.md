# Issue #35281 - "Trend chart stops working if Date column is set as Entity/Foreign Key"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium (6/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: This issue involves the interaction between data type classification and visualization rendering:
   - The backend classification logic in `insights.clj` that categorizes fields into groups
   - The frontend trend chart (SmartScalar) visualization that relies on these insights
   - The metadata system that manages field types (setting a field as Entity/Foreign Key)

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - When a date column is marked as an Entity/Foreign Key, it's being classified as `:others` instead of `:datetimes`
   - This prevents the trend chart visualization from displaying, showing an error instead
   - The issue is reproducible with a simple date field type change

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The bug is in the field classification logic in the `insights.clj` file
   - The key culprit is the line `(isa? semantic-type :Relation/*)` check that categorizes fields as `:others`
   - The fix requires modifying the classification logic to preserve the datetime nature of fields even when they're marked as relation fields

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to:
   - The `group-by` function in `metabase/analyze/fingerprint/insights.clj` which handles field classification
   - Specifically the `cond` statement with the `(isa? semantic-type :Relation/*)` check that overrides date field classification

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Setting up a date field as an Entity Key
   - Creating a time series visualization with this field
   - Verifying that the trend visualization works correctly
   - Ensuring no regressions for other field types or visualizations

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Modifying the classification logic to check for temporal types even when a field has a relation semantic type
   - Possibly reordering the conditions in the `cond` statement to prioritize the temporal nature over relation status
   - A comment from a contributor already identified a minimal fix, removing the first check in the `cond` statement

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium difficulty bug because:
- It involves the interface between backend field classification and frontend visualization
- The classification logic is fairly complex, considering multiple field attributes
- The bug has been partially diagnosed by a contributor who found a working fix
- Testing needs to cover various field type configurations to ensure the fix doesn't break other scenarios
- The fix might require balancing between entity relationships and data types

A developer with understanding of both the field metadata system and the data classification system could likely fix this in 2-4 hours, including thorough testing. The solution requires careful consideration of the classification hierarchy to ensure both entity relations and temporal data are properly handled.
