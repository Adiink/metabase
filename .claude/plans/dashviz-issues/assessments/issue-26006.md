# Issue #26006 - "No option to disable fractions/decimals in y-axis when the values are integer"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium-Low (4/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: This issue is highly related to #6767 and involves the y-axis label formatting in charts when displaying integer values:
   - `/frontend/src/metabase/visualizations/echarts/cartesian/option/axis.ts` - Handles y-axis configuration
   - Number formatting utilities that determine how to display numeric values

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - The y-axis shows decimal places (e.g., "5.0") for integer-only data
   - This specifically occurs when "Auto y-axis range" is enabled and values are small (<5)
   - The user wants a setting to force integer display or automatic detection of integer values

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The issue requires modifying the y-axis formatter to respect the integer nature of the data
   - May involve adding a new setting in the visualization options for controlling decimal display
   - Alternatively, could implement automatic detection based on data type

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue can be narrowed down to:
   - `buildMetricAxis` function in `axis.ts` which sets the formatter for Y-axis labels 
   - The `getYAxisRange` function which handles auto-range settings
   - Number formatting utilities used by these functions

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating charts with integer values using auto y-axis range
   - Verifying that axis labels show integer values without decimal places
   - Testing with mixed data (both integers and decimals) to verify appropriate handling

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires one of these approaches:
   - Adding a new visualization setting for integer/decimal display preferences
   - Enhancing the Y-axis formatter to detect integer values and format appropriately
   - Potentially modifying auto-range calculation to consider value types

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium-low difficulty bug because:
- It's very similar to issue #6767, so the same solution might work for both
- The change is focused on formatting logic rather than core rendering
- The code area is well-defined and contained to axis formatting
- Implementation approaches are straightforward to understand
- Testing should be relatively simple to complete

A developer familiar with the visualization system could likely fix this bug in 1-3 hours, including testing. The solution could potentially be combined with the fix for #6767 since they appear to be addressing the same underlying issue from slightly different angles. The key decision is whether to add a new explicit setting or implement automatic detection of integer values.
