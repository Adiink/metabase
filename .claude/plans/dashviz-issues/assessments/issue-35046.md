# Issue #35046 - "Changing decimal values of a measure directly impacts the y-axis scale values"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium (5/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: This issue involves the interaction between column formatting settings and axis scale/label rendering:
   - Number formatting system in `metabase/lib/formatting/numbers.tsx`
   - Column settings in `metabase/visualizations/lib/settings/column.js`
   - Axis rendering in `metabase/visualizations/echarts/cartesian/option/axis.ts`

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - When changing the decimal places setting for a column to 0, the y-axis scale becomes visually broken
   - The issue is reproducible with a simple SQL query and bar chart visualization
   - From the screenshots, the y-axis loses its proper tick marks and scale

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The bug involves the interaction between column-specific formatting settings and chart axis rendering
   - The fix requires understanding how decimal formatting settings propagate to the axis scale calculation
   - There may be a disconnect between data formatting and axis formatting that needs to be reconciled

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: The issue involves multiple components:
   - How column settings for decimal places are applied
   - How these settings affect (or should not affect) the axis scale calculation
   - How the axis rendering system handles formatted values

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating a visualization with numeric data
   - Setting different decimal place configurations
   - Verifying that the y-axis maintains proper scale and formatting
   - Testing with various data ranges and decimal settings

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Decoupling the axis scale calculation from column display formatting
   - Ensuring that changing decimal places affects only the display of values, not the scale calculation
   - Potentially updating how axis ticks are generated when decimal places are adjusted

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium difficulty bug because:
- It involves the interaction between multiple systems (formatting, column settings, axis rendering)
- The fix requires a deeper understanding of how formatting settings propagate through the visualization system
- It may require architectural changes to properly separate display formatting from scale calculation
- Testing needs to cover a range of scenarios to ensure the fix doesn't introduce regressions

A developer would need to be familiar with both the column settings system and the chart rendering system to properly diagnose and fix this issue. The solution will likely require careful consideration to ensure that other chart configurations are not affected. Estimated time to fix: 3-5 hours including testing across various scenarios.
