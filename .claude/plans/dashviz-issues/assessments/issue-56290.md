# Issue #56290 - "Event not shown on chart"

## Difficulty Assessment
**Score: Medium (6/10)**

### Technical Complexity Analysis:
1. **Component Identification**: The AreaChart component is a wrapper over CartesianChart, which handles rendering for multiple chart types. The timeline events display logic is shared among chart types.

2. **Issue Characteristics**: 
   - The issue specifically affects area charts while other chart types display events correctly
   - Events are detected and processed but not displaying visually
   - The bug is isolated to one chart type rather than being a system-wide failure

3. **Implementation Complexity**:
   - The timeline events rendering occurs in multiple files:
     - `use-chart-events.ts` handles event interactions
     - `timeline-events/model.ts` processes the data
     - `timeline-events/option.ts` provides ECharts configuration
   - Area charts inherit from the common CartesianChart, suggesting the issue is in the area-specific rendering logic

### Resolution Factors:
1. **Localization**: We can narrow down the issue to differences in how the area chart renders marker lines compared to other chart types like line or bar charts.

2. **Testing Approach**: Testing will require:
   - Creating a time series visualization with area chart
   - Adding timeline events
   - Verifying events display properly
   - Comparing with other chart types that work correctly

3. **Fix Complexity**: The fix likely requires:
   - Understanding how area charts' stacking/filling behavior affects marker lines
   - Adjusting the z-index or rendering approach for timeline events in area charts
   - Ensuring the fix doesn't affect other chart types

### Overall Assessment:
This is a medium-difficulty bug because:
- The issue is well-isolated to area charts
- The visualization system is modular with clear separation of concerns
- We have a clear reproduction path
- Testing is straightforward
- The fix will likely require moderate understanding of the ECharts library and how Metabase configures it for different chart types
- The required changes will likely be small but require careful attention to details in the rendering logic

A developer with some familiarity with the visualization system could likely fix this in 2-4 hours, including testing across different scenarios.
