Note that the name of the file in the url you pass to h2 is `sample-database.db` **not** `sample-database.db.mv.db` even though the latter is the name of the file on your filesystem!\n    * `rm plugins/sample-database.db.*`\n    * `java -cp ~/Downloads/jars/h2-2.1.214.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:file:./resources/sample-database.db -script /tmp/nz-people-sample.sql`\n* start your metabase as usual, e.g. `yarn dev` or whatever you normally do\n\nAssuming your Sample DB now has the NZ data\n\n1.

I believe it is mostly caused because when you edit multiple metrics or pivot fields at the same time looks like the pivot table is processing the changes one by one in which looks like a queue. \r\n\r\nIf each change takes one minute to process, the user needs to wait a lot of time to have their final pivot table design ready and it is confusing to the end user to see some changes appear on their screen but not be what they wanted in the end, causing further attempts to make changes that cause even more confusion.\r\n\r\nWhat would make sense is that whatever change is done in a pivot table instantly invalidates whatever work it was doing previously because if multiple metrics were changed, only the last change done is the desired one and any previous processing that was to be done is basically useless. \r\n\r\nI noticed https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/28945 was an initial improvement in this direction but pivot table design is still confusing for end users IMO.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate pivot table with multiple row aggregations and column pivot fields.\r\nTry to pivot 2 or more columns to be pivot columns at the same time. It will either process one pivot change at a time or rollback the changes you tried to do.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\npivot table instantly invalidates whatever work it was doing previously allowing moving multiple pivot fields at one go.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nNo relevant logs.\r\n\r\n### Information about your Metabase installation\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"browser-info\": {\r\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\r\n    \"platform\": \"MacIntel\",\r\n    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\",\r\n    \"vendor\": \"Google Inc.\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system-info\": {\r\n    \"file.encoding\": \"UTF-8\",\r\n    \"java.runtime.name\": \"OpenJDK Runtime Environment\",\r\n    \"java.runtime.version\": \"11.0.23+9\",\r\n    \"java.vendor\": \"Eclipse Adoptium\",\r\n    \"java.vendor.url\": \"https://adoptium.net/\",\r\n    \"java.version\": \"11.0.23\",\r\n    \"java.vm.name\": \"OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\",\r\n    \"java.vm.version\": \"11.0.23+9\",\r\n    \"os.name\": \"Linux\",\r\n    \"os.version\": \"5.10.216-204.855.amzn2.x86_64\",\r\n    \"user.language\": \"en\",\r\n    \"user.timezone\": \"UTC\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"metabase-info\": {\r\n    \"databases\": [\r\n      \"postgres\",\r\n      \"h2\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"hosting-env\": \"unknown\",\r\n    \"application-database\": \"postgres\",\r\n    \"application-database-details\": {\r\n      \"database\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"PostgreSQL\",\r\n        \"version\": \"16.1\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"jdbc-driver\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"PostgreSQL JDBC Driver\",\r\n        \"version\": \"42.7.3\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"run-mode\": \"prod\",\r\n    \"version\": {\r\n      \"date\": \"2024-06-19\",\r\n      \"tag\": \"v1.50.6\",\r\n      \"hash\": \"a5fbebf\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"report-timezone\": null\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nP2\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAczgH86i8wEj","author":{"login":"cdeweyx"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"[Thread trying to repro this](https://metaboat.slack.com/archives/C064QMXEV9N/p1742307824599459) — Can sometimes get to this state with a big enough pivot and fast enough movement of columns, but hard to do.

When you have a dashboard that doesn't allow drilling down, or any clicking behavior, the cursor is stille changed, and scrolling behavior blocks when clicking on the chart. I understand that this is something minor, but it is not handy when you have multiple charts underneath each other in an embedded view.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add some timeseries charts underneath each other in a dashboard\r\n2. Embed it in an application where you need to scroll\r\n3. Click in the chart (not on the data)\r\n4. Try scrolling. This doesn't work\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nScrolling should still be possible\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Information about your Metabase installation\r\n\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n  \"browser-info\": {\r\n    \"language\": \"en-GB\",\r\n    \"platform\": \"MacIntel\",\r\n    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36\",\r\n    \"vendor\": \"Google Inc.\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system-info\": {\r\n    \"file.encoding\": \"UTF-8\",\r\n    \"java.runtime.name\": \"OpenJDK Runtime Environment\",\r\n    \"java.runtime.version\": \"11.0.22+7\",\r\n    \"java.vendor\": \"Eclipse Adoptium\",\r\n    \"java.vendor.url\": \"https://adoptium.net/\",\r\n    \"java.version\": \"11.0.22\",\r\n    \"java.vm.name\": \"OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\",\r\n    \"java.vm.version\": \"11.0.22+7\",\r\n    \"os.name\": \"Linux\",\r\n    \"os.version\": \"5.10.198-187.748.amzn2.x86_64\",\r\n    \"user.language\": \"en\",\r\n    \"user.timezone\": \"UTC\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"metabase-info\": {\r\n    \"databases\": [\r\n      \"postgres\",\r\n      \"h2\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"hosting-env\": \"unknown\",\r\n    \"application-database\": \"postgres\",\r\n    \"application-database-details\": {\r\n      \"database\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"PostgreSQL\",\r\n        \"version\": \"14.10\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"jdbc-driver\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"PostgreSQL JDBC Driver\",\r\n        \"version\": \"42.7.2\"\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"run-mode\": \"prod\",\r\n    \"version\": {\r\n      \"date\": \"2024-03-14\",\r\n      \"tag\": \"v1.49.0\",\r\n      \"hash\": \"46c668b\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n      \"report-timezone\": null\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nminor\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAczgH853zRJN","author":{"login":"paoliniluis"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"metabase version?

Even when it appears that you (manually) set the width properly, everything goes down the drain when you check it from another computer. This occurs with the default full-width mode enabled, so fixed width has become the forced go-to option for many dashboards.\r\n\r\n* Changes in the number of columns within pivot tables lead to underfill/overfill as seen on this issue. This happens frequently, e.g., when using some filter or when new data with new categories appears.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE] \r\n> After several months (>12) using Metabase as the main BI tool across the company, this could be the main concern reported from the different departments regarding UX-UI.
