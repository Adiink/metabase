reason: USER_FEEDBACK
user prompt:
  - User pointed out that I over-complicated the initial command handling
  - User questioned why I attempted to create implementation of an existing command
  
agent reflection:
  - I ignored the command's instructions to simply check arguments and return usage
  - I incorrectly assumed I needed to implement the command functionality
  - I performed multiple unnecessary tool calls before returning the usage message
  - I failed to recognize that the command was already implemented

agent learnings:
  - Follow command instructions exactly as written without adding extra steps
  - Check arguments first before taking any other actions
  - Trust the command file's logic and flow
  - When receiving user feedback about mistakes, log it as instructed
