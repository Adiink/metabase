Based on my review of Metabase documentation, here's my understanding of the DashViz team's scope:

The DashViz team is responsible for Metabase's visualization engine, which includes:

1. Visualization types: Tables, bar/line/area charts, combo charts, scatter plots, pie/donut charts, funnels, histograms, gauges, progress bars, sankey charts, maps, and specialized displays.

2. Visualization settings across multiple levels:
   - Chart-specific settings (axes, legends, colors, data display options)
   - Global settings affecting all visualizations
   - Field-level formatting and display settings
   - Model, question, dashboard card, and series-specific settings

3. Dashboard visualization framework:
   - Rendering visualizations in dashboards
   - Managing card layouts, sizing, and arrangement
   - Dashboard interactivity including cross-filtering

4. Visualization delivery systems:
   - Email/Slack dashboard subscriptions
   - Alerts based on visualization data
   - PDF/image exports

5. Interactive features:
   - Click behaviors and drill-through capabilities
   - Custom tooltips and data exploration
   - Cross-filtering between dashboard elements

This team bridges front-end rendering with the backend systems that support visualization features throughout the Metabase application.
