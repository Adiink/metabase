# Learn From This Command

## Instructions

This command allows you to reflect on and document insights from the most recent part of our conversation. When invoked, I will:

1. Analyze only the last 2-3 exchanges between us
2. Generate insights about what worked well or could be improved
3. Log these reflections to help improve future interactions

## Process

1. When this command is invoked, I'll create a new log entry in `.claude/logs/learn-from-this.log`
2. I'll reflect on only the most recent exchanges, focusing particularly on:
   - My latest response and its quality
   - Any errors that were triggered
   - The efficiency of my approach to your request
   - Any metrics available (response time, token usage)
   - Immediate patterns worth noting

## Log Format

Each entry in the log file will follow this format:

```markdown
### New Entry
timestamp: <ISO timestamp>
recent request:
  - <bullet point summary of your recent request>
agent reflection:
  - <bullet point analysis of my handling of the request>
agent learnings:
  - <bullet point insights for handling similar requests better>
```

## Entry Components

### Recent Request
A brief bullet-point summary of what you asked in your most recent 1-2 prompts.

### Agent Reflection
A bullet-point analysis explaining:
- What aspects of the request were handled well
- What aspects were challenging or took significant time/tokens
- Any misunderstandings or areas where clarification was needed

### Agent Learnings
Bullet points on how to improve future similar requests:
- More efficient approaches to similar problems
- Information that would have been helpful to have upfront
- Specific techniques that worked well and should be repeated

After logging, I'll share a brief summary of what I've learned directly in our conversation.
