  Review what has happened so far in this conversation and produce a summary report.
  Include things like:
  - What is the goal of this project and this first phase?
  - What progress has been made and what is left to do?
  - What was efficient about this plan structure and what are areas of improvement potentially?
  - Reflect on why you were able to cross multiple steps as completed at once. Did we not define our steps clearly or was there something wrong in the step sequence?
  - It is important that incremental pieces of functionality should be tested with a new unit test before moving on to the next step. This helps catch errors early and
  more accurately.
  Save this summary report somewhere you think is appropriate. I will ask you to read this report in the future when I begin working on this again, so if you know of
  anything else that would be helpful for you in the future make mention of those (beyond the things I have already covered here).
